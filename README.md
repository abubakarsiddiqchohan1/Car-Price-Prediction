# ðŸš— Car Price Prediction with GUI | AI Lab Project of my 4th Semester university project 

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This was my **4th semester project** for the **Artificial Intelligence Lab** course, part of the **BS Data Science** degree. It is a **Car Price Prediction System** that combines **Machine Learning** with a **Tkinter-based GUI** to provide an interactive way for users to estimate used car prices.

## ðŸ’» What It Does

- Trains a **Linear Regression** model on a cleaned dataset of used cars
- Encodes categorical features using **LabelEncoder**
- Builds a **Pipeline** for streamlined preprocessing and model training
- Allows users to **input car details via GUI** (Company, Model, Year, Fuel Type, KM Driven)
- Predicts the **estimated car price instantly** in the GUI window

## ðŸ§  Technologies & Libraries

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for EDA)

## ðŸŽ¯ Features of the Application

- Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- Model training and evaluation
- Fully functional **Tkinter GUI**
- Dropdowns and Entry Fields for:
  - Car Company
  - Car Model
  - Year of Purchase
  - Fuel Type
  - Kilometers Driven
- Result shown directly in the window

## ðŸ“Š Machine Learning Pipeline

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle null values
   - Convert strings to numerical format
2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Combine columns where necessary
3. **Model Training**
   - Linear Regression via Scikit-learn
4. **Model Deployment**
   - Used via GUI (not as web app, but desktop app)
